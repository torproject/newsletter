title: v2 onion services deprecation, Bug Smash  2021, Announcing Arti
---
body:
## Onion service admins must upgrade to v3 onion services as soon as possible
https://blog.torproject.org/v2-deprecation-timeline

If you are an onion site administrator, you must upgrade to v3 onion services as soon as possible.

As we announced last year, v2 onion services will be deprecated and obsolete in Tor 0.4.6.x. As of April 2021, Tor Browser Alpha uses this version of Tor and v2 addresses no longer work in this and future versions of Tor Browser Alpha.

When Tor Browser stable moves to Tor 0.4.6.x in October 2021, v2 onion addresses will be completely unreachable.

Why are we deprecating v2 onion services? Safety. Technologies used in v2 onion services are vulnerable to different kinds of attacks, and v2 onion services are no longer being developed or maintained. The new version of onion services provides improved encryption and enhanced privacy for administrators and users.

It's critical that onion service administrators migrate to v3 onion services and work to inform users about this change as soon as possible.

## Snowflake moving to stable in Tor Browser 10.5
https://blog.torproject.org/snowflake-in-tor-browser-stable

We're excited to announce that Snowflake (https://snowflake.torproject.org) will be shipped as one of the default bridge options with stable versions of Tor Browser later this month.

What is Snowflake? Snowflake is a pluggable transport that uses a combination of domain fronting and peer-to-peer WebRTC connections between clients and volunteers to circumvent Internet censorship. Snowflake is highly censorship resistant, and used only for the initial bootstrapping of the connection. As such, it requires much lower bandwidth and shorter connections than existing domain fronting pluggable transports like meek (https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/meek.git/), making it a more scalable alternative.

For more about Snowflake, its design, and how it works for users, visit our blog: https://blog.torproject.org/snowflake-in-tor-browser-stable

## Improving the user experience of connecting to Tor in Tor Browser 10.5
https://blog.torproject.org/improving-ux-connecting-to-tor-105

Say goodbye to Tor Launcher.

During the past few years, the UX team has been working on qualitatively improving the entire Tor Browser user journey: from discovering to finding, downloading, installing, starting, and browsing; we released a seamless and familiar experience for our largest user base.

Users have specifically reported that they find Tor Launcher confusing. Research exposed these pain points and has demonstrated how confusion caused by cognitive overload delays the userâ€™s decision-making flow. Known issues with Tor Launcher, like the time gap between Tor Launcher and the main browser window opening after first-time installation, has left some users disappointed.
