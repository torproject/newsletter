Not only is privacy possible, it is being built right now if our latest updates are any indication: From a new command-line utility isolating Tor network information on Linux to creating smaller network footprints and infrastructure with cryptographic *Family Certificates*, read all about how our latest releases and your contributions make privacy the default.

## Privacy is possible -- even when it feels out of reach

Opting out of Big Tech means investing in better alternatives. That's where Tor, Tor Browser, and Tails come in. Help fuel the development of truly private tools and learn how to get involved in our spring fundraising campaign: https://blog.torproject.org/sc25/.

## Introducing oniux: Kernel-level Tor isolation for any Linux app

Learn more about Kernel-level Tor isolation for any Linux app. This torsocks alternative uses namespaces to isolate Linux applications over the Tor network and eliminate data leaks. But how does it work exactly? Find out here: https://blog.torproject.org/introducing-oniux-tor-isolation-using-linux-namespaces/.

## Happy Families: new certificates for faster and easier relay management

Relay Families are Tor's way of grouping together relays run by the same operator, providing security and operational transparency. But the current 20-year-old design bloats directory info and becomes a maintenance headache as families grow. Tor 0.4.9 (currently in alpha) introduces cryptographic family certificates to help save up to 50% of the bandwidth cost for initial connections to the Tor network. Here's how it works, and what you can do to speed up the transition: https://blog.torproject.org/happy-families/.

# Keeping up with the latest releases

## Quo vadis OS Spoofing?

Don't worry, it's here to stay! There's been some online speculation and confusion around OS Spoofing in Tor Browser as a result of Tor Browser's latest stable release. Let's be clear, OS spoofing has never gone anywhere and is here to stay! In fact, Tor has harmonized the experience across Desktop and Mobile.

To support informed discussion, here's what actually changed, and what hasn't changed: We are still protecting user agents. Tor Browser has always limited user agents to general categories--Windows, macOS, Linux, or Android in JavaScript, and Windows or Android in HTTP Headers. That means we spoof the OS version and architecture, which was always the approach in JavaScript--now it's consistent in HTTP headers too.

## Sliding into your...security settings

On a related note, we'd like to thank Privacy Guides for spearheading a productive discussion around a flaw in Tor Browser's security slider [1]. The Tor Project is aware of this issue, and it is being tracked and actively addressed--those interested can follow the discussion and progress here: https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/42572.

Many ideas are on the table: In addition to a restart prompt, we're also exploring broader improvements to the security level system, including aligning it more closely with Tor Browser's updated threat model (check out our design doc: http://https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/wiki/-/wikis/ Design-Documents/Tor-Browser-Design-Doc) and possibly delegating even more of its back-end to NoScript for additional flexibility. These improvements may be part of the upcoming 15.0 release cycle.
