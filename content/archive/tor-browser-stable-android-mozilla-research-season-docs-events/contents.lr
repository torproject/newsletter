												<h1>Tor Browser is Stable on Android</h1>

												<p><a href="https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-85"><img alt="Tor Browser logo " src="https://blog.torproject.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/image/lead%20image%20%402x_0.png?itok=_H_NqtrI" style="width: 640px; height: 312px;" /></a></p>

												<p>Since we released the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/new-alpha-release-tor-browser-android">first alpha version of Tor Browser for Android in September</a>, we&#39;ve been hard at work making sure we can provide the protections users already enjoying on desktop to the Android platform. Mobile browsing is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/02/mobile-web-browsing-desktop-smartphones-tablets">increasing</a> around the world, and in some parts, it is commonly the only way people access the internet. In these same areas, there is often heavy surveillance and censorship online, so we made it a priority to reach these users with a mobile Tor Browser release. The stable version of Tor Browser for Android is now available for download from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.torbrowser">Google Play</a>, <a href="https://www.f-droid.org/">F-Droid</a>, and <a href="https://torproject.org">our website</a>.</p>

												<p>We made sure there are no proxy bypasses, that first-party isolation is enabled to protect you from cross-site tracking, and that most of the fingerprinting defenses are working. While there are still <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?status=accepted&amp;status=assigned&amp;status=merge_ready&amp;status=needs_information&amp;status=needs_review&amp;status=needs_revision&amp;status=new&amp;status=reopened&amp;keywords=~tbb-parity&amp;order=priority">feature gaps</a> between the desktop and Android Tor Browser, we are confident that Tor Browser for Android provides essentially the same protections that can be found on desktop platforms. <strong>These protections are unmatched by any other browser.</strong></p>

												<p>The latest version of Tor Browser across all platforms also features UX and branding improvements in line with developments begun last year with the release of <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-85">Tor Browser 8</a>.</p>

												<p>As always, we rely on feedback to improve our software. So if you have any suggestions or find a bug, <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/community/HowToReportBugFeedback">please let us know</a>.</p>

												<p><span class="quickedit-field" data-quickedit-field-id="node/1721/title/en/full" property="schema:name"><a href="https://blog.torproject.org/mozilla-research-call-tune-tor-integration-and-scale"><img alt="" src="https://blog.torproject.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/image/mozilla-research-tor.jpg.png?itok=c7VjJymK" style="width: 640px; height: 320px;" /></a></span></p>

												<p>What alternative protocol architectures and route selection protocols would offer acceptable gains in Tor performance? Would they preserve Tor properties? Is it possible to improve Tor performance without changing protocols? Is it truly possible to deploy Tor at scale? And what would the full integration of Tor and Firefox look like? Those are some of the questions that <a href="https://mozilla-research.forms.fm/mozilla-research-grants-2019h1/forms/6510">Mozilla is calling researchers</a> to answer in the privacy &amp; security part of their Mozilla Research Grants program.</p>

												<p>Integrating Tor into Firefox would bring real private browsing and a safer internet experience to an unprecedented number of people around the world. But Tor has never been deployed at this scale, and there are a lot of considerations to research before Mozilla gives this a try.</p>

												<p>Find out more about the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/mozilla-research-call-tune-tor-integration-and-scale">areas needing research and how you can apply</a>. The deadline for applications is May 31.</p>

												<h1><span property="schema:name">Google Season of Docs 2019: Help Tor Improve Our Documentation </span></h1>

												<p><span property="schema:name"><a href="https://blog.torproject.org/google-season-docs-2019-help-tor-improve-our-documentation"><img alt="Season of Docs " src="https://blog.torproject.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/image/SeasonofDocs_Logo_SecondaryGrey_300ppi.png?itok=sfHCIJuA" style="width: 640px; height: 172px;" /></a></span></p>

												<p>There are a few elements that are critical for the sustainability of an open source project. One of them is good documentation.</p>

												<p>Although often neglected, documentation can be crucial for open source projects to provide meaningful guides on how to start contributing and guides on the architecture of the technology being developed.</p>

												<p>These resources help not only newcomers and contributors to understand the technological aspects of a project but can also expose both decision making and work processes, outlining the best way to contribute.</p>

												<p>This year Google has launched <a href="http://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/participants/">Season of Docs</a>, and we&#39;ve been accepted as a mentoring organization. The program runs for approximately 3 months from September to November 2019 and there is additionally the option of a &quot;long-running project&quot; which goes on for approximately 5 months, from September 2019 to February 2020.</p>

												<p>We&rsquo;re a small nonprofit organization that develops free and open source software used by millions around the world, and our community of contributors and users would greatly benefit from improved documentation. If you can help us out, <a href="http://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/participants/">learn more about how to apply</a>.</p>
