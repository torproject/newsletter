## Supporting Tor users via Telegram

When the Russian government blocked Tor in December 2021, the Tor Project Anti-censorship Team launched a new Telegram bot to share bridges and help users to circumvent censorship.

Because we've see our initial Telegram bot help thousands of users, and because Telegram is a very popular messaging platform in the Russian-speaking community, we're launching more services on Telegram:

 - TorProject: Our official news channel on Telegram. We will deliver essential updates from the Tor Project.

 - GetTor_bot (https://t.me/GetTor_bot): If you can't download Tor Browser through our website, you can get a copy of Tor Browser delivered to you via GetTor. GetTor is a service that automatically responds to messages with links to the latest version of Tor Browser.
 
- GetBridgesBot (https://t.me/GetBridgesbot): If you can't access Tor because the network is censored in your region, you can request a Tor bridge using this Telegram bot and use this bridge to circumvent censorship.

- TorProjectSupportBot (https://t.me/TorProjectSupportBot): If you can't connect to Tor or you need help setting up Tor Browser, a live Tor user support specialist will help you. The help desk is available in English and Russian, and it's open for all users living in censored regions.

Join us on Telegram and help spread the word that these resources are available!

## Open call for Tor Board members
https://www.torproject.org/about/jobs/board-of-directors

We are happy to announce that for the first time the Tor Project Board has published an open call for candidates to become new members of the Board: https://www.torproject.org/about/jobs/board-of-directors/. The goal of this open call is to provide a way for the whole community to participate in this process.

We believe that this new process will not only help us find great new members for our Board but will also generate new relationships and get us closer to the communities that Tor serves.

If you are interested in giving back to Tor in a governance role, we encourage you to submit an application before Sept. 30.

## Arti 1.0.0 is released and ready for production use ðŸŽ‰ 
https://blog.torproject.org/arti_100_released

Back in 2020, we started work on a new implementation of the Tor protocols in the Rust programming language. With Arti 1.0.0, we believe it's ready for wider use.

This means that you should be able to use Arti in the real world to get a similar degree of privacy, usability, and stability to what you would with a C client Tor. The APIs should be (more or less) stable for embedders. You can now use arti proxy to connect to the Tor network to anonymize your network connections.

To achieve this, we we've made many improvements to Arti. For a complete list of changes, and to learn more about Arti 1.0.0, visit our blog: https://blog.torproject.org/arti_100_released.

## New Releases
