									<p><strong>Dear Tor Community,</strong></p>

									<p>From welcoming Amnesty International as our <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/amnesty-international-launches-onion-service/">latest member in the onion services community </a>to <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/tor-network-community-health-update/">shoring up the Tor network</a> and hosting our <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/state-of-the-onion-2023/">annual State of the Onion</a>, the Tor Project&#39;s teams remain focused on <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/support-tor-project-share-your-story/">making an impact in people&#39;s lives</a>. We want to give special thanks to everyone who has shared their story and participated in our recent survey about the <a href="https://survey.torproject.org/index.php/615919">importance of encryption</a>&ndash;the response rate has been incredible&ndash;and on top of being insightful, your contributions will go a long way to improving our advocacy and outreach efforts.</p>

									<p>Remember, from now on through December 31st, <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/friends-of-tor-match-2023/">your donation will be matched</a> by our Friends of Tor&ndash;which means that a $25 donation will automatically become $50 until the end of this year.</p>

									<p><em>&nbsp; - Thank you for being an essential part of the Tor Project&#39;s community.</em></p>

									<h1>Tor News</h1>

									<h2><a href="https://blog.torproject.org/tor-network-ddos-attack/"><img alt="Tor and Amnesty logo above a screenshot of the Amnesty.org website on a blue-purple gradient background" src="https://newsletter.torproject.org/gallery/2023-12/amnesty-onion-site-pill.png" style="width: 675px; height: 380px;" /></a></h2>

									<h2><strong>Amnesty International now available as .onion</strong></h2>

									<p>Amnesty International has launched their website as a .onion site to provide unrestricted access to their human rights resources, enabling more people to safely and securely engage with the vital work of speaking truth to power, and defending human rights. We couldn&#39;t be happier with Amnesty&#39;s choice to offer a .onion site on the Tor network. This underlines the critical role of our open source privacy technology as a vital tool in our shared work of advancing human rights.<br />
									Read the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/amnesty-international-launches-onion-service/">full story here</a>. And if you&#39;re a website operator, interested in following suit, <a href="https://nc.torproject.net/apps/forms/s/bGswKTbTj8ikYb4oPen9W9ig">connect with our onion support team</a>.</p>

									<h2><strong>Safeguarding the Tor network: our commitment to network health and supporting relay operators</strong></h2>

									<p>You may have noticed that we recently removed a large number of relays from the Tor network. We did this to protect network health and the safety and security of our community and users. This process has sparked larger discussions within our teams and community members about the state of Tor relay policies and the potential for incentivization models that can better support our relay operators and the growth of the Tor network. It has also encouraged us to reflect more deeply on our mission and the role of free, open-source technology.<br />
									For these reasons, we published a blog post to highlight past research exploring incentivization models for relay operators, and to provide <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/tor-network-community-health-update/">insight into the rationale behind our recent actions to protect the network.</a></p>

									<h2><strong>Transparency, openness, and our 2021-2022 financials</strong></h2>

									<p>Did you know that almost a third of our annual revenue comes from individual donors? These gifts come in all different forms (including ten different cryptocurrencies, which are then converted to USD): Some people donate $5 to the Tor Project one time, some donate $100 every month, and some make large gifts annually. The common thread is that individual donations are unrestricted funds, and a very important kind of support. Unrestricted funds allow us to respond to censorship events, develop our tools in a more agile way, and ensure we have reserves to keep Tor strong in case of emergencies.</p>

									<p>If you didn&#39;t know, make sure to check out <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/transparency-openness-and-our-2021-and-2022-financials/">our 2021-2022 fiscal report</a>.</p>

									<p>And, if you want to maximize your donation this year, now is the time! From now on through December 31st, your donation will be matched by our Friends of Tor&ndash;which means that <a href="https://torproject.org/donate/donate-tn3-2023">a $25 donation will automatically become $50 until the end of this year.</a></p>
