									<h2><a href="https://blog.torproject.org/tor-network-ddos-attack/"><img alt="Illustration of a person holding their hand up to stop someone with protest signs in the back next to a block of text saying 'Fight censorship with Tor'" src="https://blog.torproject.org/2024-defend-internet-freedom-during-elections/lead.webp" style="width: 675px; height: 380px;" /></a></h2>

									<h2><strong>Defending access to information during the Year of Democracy</strong></h2>

									<p>2024 has been dubbed the &quot;Year of Democracy&quot; with over 65 elections taking place globally and roughly 2 billion people casting their votes this year. We have seen spikes of censorship events around elections. In this context, Tor and Tor-powered apps can protect and defend our right to freely access information.</p>

									<p>We <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/2024-defend-internet-freedom-during-elections/">put together a guide on how at-risk users can prepare themselves</a> for upcoming elections by downloading Tor-powered applications like <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/">Tor Browser</a>, <a href="http://orbot.app">Orbot</a>, <a href="https://tails.net/">Tails</a>, and <a href="https://onionshare.org/">OnionShare</a> before election censorship happens.</p>

									<p>For these tools to work effectively, we all need to work together. Please consider volunteering by <a href="https://snowflake.torproject.org/">running a Snowflake proxy</a> or <a href="https://community.torproject.org/relay/setup/bridge/">Tor bridge</a>. But there are many more ways to get involved and expand global access to Tor: from organizing <a href="https://community.torproject.org/training/resources/">Tor trainings</a> to <a href="https://community.torproject.org/localization/">providing translations</a>, documenting online censorship or <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/campaign/keepiton/#coalition">advocating against internet shutdowns</a>.</p>

									<h2><strong>2023 year-end fundraising results ðŸŽ‰</strong></h2>

									<p>Another great way to support the Tor Project&#39;s efforts is by donating--and that&#39;s what so many of you have done. From October through December 2023, you answered the call for support by contributing $427,558 to power the Tor network, Tor Browser, onion services, Snowflake, and the ecosystem of tools and services built and maintained by the Tor Project.</p>

									<p>Everyone in our community deserves a big THANK YOU for supporting the Tor Project during the campaign. Whether you made a donation, shared the campaign on social media, or spread the world about the importance of using Tor, your contributions are vital to achieving our mission. Your impact was then amplified by <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/friends-of-tor-match-2023/">the Friends of Tor</a> who provided the generous match during the campaign.</p>

									<h2><strong>Empowering young minds</strong></h2>

									<p>Earlier this month, we sat down with <a href="https://fsfe.org/index.en.html">Matthias Kirschner, President of the FSFE (Free Software Foundation Europe)</a> to talk about a children&#39;s book he has authored exploring the themes of the internet, free and open source technology, and its vital role for democracy.<br />
									In <a href="https://fsfe.org/activities/ada-zangemann/">Ada &amp; Zangemann</a>, the young hardware enthusiast, Ada, takes on Zangeman, an inventor who begins controlling all of the world&#39;s computerized devices to do exactly what he wants. As part of our conversation, we gained some valuable insights for parents, caretakers, and educators seeking ways to talk about technology in accessible and child-friendly ways.</p>
