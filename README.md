# Newsletter

Our newsletter is a means of gathering important bits of updates and opportunities from across the organization and community.

The newsletter is scheduled on a monthly basis.   

The newsletter is published [here](https://newsletter.torproject.org/), but a lot of readers prefer to get an email when a new edition is being published.

You can simply subscribe to the newsletter by providing your email and completing the verification on the [newsletter page](https://newsletter.torproject.org/).

> **NOTE:** The information you provide will only be used to send you updates and opportunities from Tor. You can unsubscribe at any time. We will not publish, sell, trade, share, or rent any information about you. Never.
